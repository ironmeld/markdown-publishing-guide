# Markdown Publishing Guide v1.0.2-prerelease
A guide to publishing Markdown documents on GitHub and ReadTheDocs

## Introduction
This is a guide to writing and publishing Markdown documents on GitHub and ReadTheDocs.
It includes steb-by-step instructions for using GitHub, git, Markdown, and ReadTheDocs in order to
produce a well-formatted set of documents with a detailed table of contents.

This document itself was created using the instructions in this document.

## Motivation
This document was created to help others write documents in Markdown and have them look good on both GitHub and ReadTheDocs.
By "good" I mean that on ReadTheDocs it has a table of contents page and there is a left navigation pane with topics
that expands hierarchically.

It took a while to figure out how to setup my files on GitHub in a way would produce good results so I 
decided to document the procedures I came up with. I also included a very basic git workflow to support multiple versions.

These instructions are published with Creative Commons Zero license which basically says
you can do what you want with this content and you don't have to add any attributions
or do anything really - just copy it.

## Scope
These instructions are intended for new, standalone documents like this one, that do not require
a sophisticated git branching and collaboration workflow. 
This workflow does not use pull requests. Editing is done on the master branch. 
In order to handle developing a new version over multiple edits, the master branch is marked
as a "prerelease" until the release is ready, at which point the "prerelease" status is removed.
When a release is created, this workflow creates a tag for the new release and merges the 
release tag to a branch named "latest-release" for convenience.
The default ReadTheDocs version will point to the master branch so that when you click 
the edit button in ReadTheDocs, it takes you to the appropriate branch for editing.
Of course, you can also ignore my suggested git workflow and substitute your own in 
order to support collaboration.


## Existing Documents and Troubleshooting

If you have an existing document and would like to add a table
of contents, for example, these instructions are not sufficient for that situation. Existing documents are unlikely
to have the same document structure (such as a using a docs subdirectory) and often have other settings and
extensions which these instructions do not anticipate. This project not have enough resources to identify all
(or really any of) the issues that can be present in existing documents that may produces unexpected results.

If you try to adapt these instructions and the document structure it describes to your current document 
and you run into problems,
you might want to consider creating a separate project just for troubleshooting. You would use this new project
in order to figure out what the problem is and then you can delete it later. The name could be the same as
your original project, with "-test" added to the end, for example. You would also create a corresponding 
copy of the project over on ReadTheDocs for troubleshooting.
                 
The troubleshooting strategy I will suggest is to start stripping away the differences between your new copy of 
your project and my simple example until the specific difference causing the problem is identified. Just start 
guessing as to what it could be.
* If you have an existing conf.py, try removing the extra configuration lines in chunks until it (the RTD index) 
  works or your file is just like mine. You may also need to adapt or remove some of your content if you 
  are relying on that configuration.
* Try removing files in your index.rst until it works or your index is pretty much like mine.
* Try moving files into the docs subdirectory so it is more like my setup.
* Try removing unusual content from your markdown docs.
* Try changing the content to be more like mine.
                 
At this point you are just trying to figure out what difference, if removed, causes the index to show up correctly. 
This process basically has to work because you either find the problem or you eventually end up with two projects 
that are essentially identical although one works (mine) and one doesn't (yours). In my experience, that's so rare 
that it is not worth worrying about until it happens.
                 
Once the difference that is causing the problem is identified, it is likely that there will be a straightforward
solution that can be applied back to your original project.

## Preparing for Development
Follow the instructions from each provider in order to perform the following tasks.

* Create a GitHub Account.
* Create a ReadTheDocs Account.
* Setup a Connection to GitHub in your ReadTheDocs account.
